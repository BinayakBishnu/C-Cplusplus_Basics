  - CV qualifiers

- const pointers

2. operators

4. classes
5. templates
6. the standard library
7. a very basic introduction to Standard Template Library (STL)

### Did you know that even char is considered an integer type? Find out in the cpp file!!
### Did you also know that some data types vary in range system to system while some don't?
