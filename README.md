# C/C++ Basics

## Beginner's approach (development going on)

This includes exhaustive descriptions of basic C++ programming. It includes
1. data types
- int, char, float, char array
- size of data types
- pointers, references
- qualifiers
  - CV qualifiers
  - Storage duration
- working with const data types
- const pointers

2. operators
3. functions
4. classes
5. templates
6. the standard library
7. a very basic introduction to Standard Template Library (STL)

### Did you know that even char is considered an integer type? Find out in the cpp file!!
### Did you also know that some data types vary in range system to system while some don't?

# Followed by them are two files, one cpp and other py to compare data structures between Python and C++
We start with array (C++) and list (Python)

Followed by stacks, queue, linked list

We end with stack and queue as linked lists

It is to show how Python and C++ implementation differ although the logic/algorithm is same

Python does not have pointers and thus class members are used

Moreover, default referencing in Python is comparable to using pointers in C++
